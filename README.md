## Music/Album Recommender

* Would really like to do an album recommender based on already owned albums which could be done through [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers)

Looked up backup plans in case the api is too much to deal with (I've gotten a key to use it but haven't had time to test it out much)

* [Spotify Tracks](https://www.kaggle.com/luckey01/test-data-set)
* [Another one, less songs but more features per song](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks)

## Stand up Comedy Recommender

* May not be totally feasible, difficult to find a Dataset that has Stand-up comedy separate from regular comedy movies/tv

[Tons of info, not separated](https://www.kaggle.com/komalkhetlani/imdb-dataset)

[Comedians DB](https://www.kaggle.com/eduardo4jesus/scomedy?select=scomedy-comedians.csv)

## Beer Recommender

* Review Dataset [BeerAdvocate](https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate)
